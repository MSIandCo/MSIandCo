# MSIandCo
Mass spectrometry imaging and complementary techniques open collaboration.

### Aims
* Bring MSI and image analysis experts together
* Collect and publish set of “benchmark” multi-modal data
* Design and develop new format/extension of imzML for multi-modal data
* Evaluate and compare existing registration methods on “benchmark” data

### How can I get involved?
Please join us at the [next meeting](#next-meeting)! You can also join the [mailing list](#mailing-lists) to be kept up-to-date as the project progresses. If you have data (MSI data and a complementary imaging modality, e.g. H&E, immunofluorescnce, imaging mass cytometry, ...) that you are willing to share, please consider [sharing it with the community](#sharing-data). 

### Next meeting
The next meeting is due to take place on 20/10/2021 at 16:00 CET. 

### Mailing lists
* MSI and co. project mailing list [Subscribe](https://www.lists.uni-marburg.de/lists/sympa/subscribe/msiandco)

### Sharing data
Data shared as part of this collaboration will be collated into a set of 'benchmark' data which will be pushlished and hosted on a public data repository. If you decide to share data with this collaboration, you (and any colleagues involved in the data acquisition) will be included as an author on the manuscript describing the benchmark data.
